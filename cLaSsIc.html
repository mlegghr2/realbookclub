        <h3 class="classh3"> 1. Harry Potter Series, by JK Rowling</h3>
        <p class="classp"> The "Harry Potter" series is a classic tale of a boy who find 
            out that he belongs in the wizarding world. Through out his seven years at Hogwarts 
            (magic school), he makes friends, enemies, and has loads of adventures.
            This series is first on our list due to its large fan base and lore. There is a website 
            called <a src="https://www.wizardingworld.com/"> pottermore,</a> and it really goes 
            indepth within the wizarding world.
            This series has seven books, in ranging quaities. In my opinin, the first four are the 
            best, and the fifth one should be avoided at all cost, but they all serve their purpose 
            and are really enjoyable the first time through. This is definently a series that can be 
            reread throughout the years, and should be. <br> <br>
            <strong>Rating: 5/10 <br>Age rating:</strong> Third grade if read aloud, and not going past the third book. Othrwise fifth and above. <br> <br>
            The author is trash and keeps trying to revive the series, but can't. They were a great story at 
            the begining but have their low points. They are a key point in many children's love for reading 
            and building a world with words. Some of the plot points are trash and Dumbledore is the worst but 
            people still like it I guess.

        <h3 class="classh3"> 2. Percy Jackson and the Olympians by Rick Riordian</h3>
        <p class="classp"> Often reffered to as "PJO", this series is also considered one of the greats. 
            Its timeless tale about Percy Jackson, a young boy who finds himself mixed up in a world of greek gods and 
            monsters ends up fighting for his life. This is also a great series, with loads of adventure and 
            great jokes for all ages. Also, the protagonist Percy couldn't care less about how great the 
            gods are and it's hilarious. The amounts of sarcasm in this series is enough to keep anybody reading. 
            This is a classic tale for just about anybody, and should be reread constantly. The witty jokes and 
            creative characters are just amazing. <br> <br>
            <strong>Rating: 9/10  <br>Age rating: </strong>Fifth or sixth grade<br> <br>
            This was many children's Harry Potter but never got the love that it deserves. It was much better and more 
            action filled. The characters were more relatable and the fan base is much less toxic. "Uncle Rick", as many 
            people call him, does keep trying to add to the series, but you see much less of it because the series isn't 
            out there as much. These books are for slightly older children than Harry Potter's first hallf, but they are still 
            a must read.
        </p>

        <h3 class='classh3'> 3. Heroes of Olympus by Rick Riordian</h3>
        <p class="classp"> Heroes of Olympus is the sequel series to PJO, follow some familiar faces, while introducing some 
            new ones. Uncle Rick takes us through not only greek life, but also explains the many different sides of the 
            gods when it comes to other belief systems. This series is also considered that last good set of books writen 
            by Uncle Rick. Others will not be listed here as I advise that you do not read them. <br> <br>
            <strong> Rating: 7/10 <br>Age rating:</strong> Late middle to early high school. <br> <br>
            For a sequel, these books are pretty great. They do have their low points, but they are an interesting take on 
            why "demigods", or, half god half human people, are still useful, even when the gods beleive that they are forgotten.
            They are a bit darker than the first series, but they are still a major part of people's literature lives.

        <h3 class="classh3"> 4. Mysterious Nenedict Society by Trenton Lee Stewart</h3>
        <p class="classp"> The last entry on this list (as of now) is The Mysterious Benedict Society, 
            a story about four kids, Reynie, Kate, Sticky, and Constance, who pass these odd tests and become friends. 
            They soon prove their resourcefulness on a crazy mission that shouldn't be spoiled. Of course there are more 
            books in the series, as well as a origin story for the maker of these test, Nicolas Benedict. The attention 
            to detail in this series is so enjoyable. All of the characters are either lovable or you love to hate them. 
            The adventures that take place in this series are crazy but enjoyable, and they inspire children to do more. <br><br>
            <strong>Rating: 10/10 <br>Age rating:</strong> Third grade and up, but read aloud to some of the younger ones <br><br>
            This is such a great series that is lesser known but still amazing. I encourage anybody to read this if they have 
            the chance.
        </p>
        <h3 class="classh3">5-6. Dork Diaries by Rachel Renee Russell And Diary Of a Wimpy Kid by Jeff Kinney </h3>
        <p class="classp"> These series are a great starter books for kids who just don't like reading because 
            it's "not relatable". Dork Diaries are more aimed at girls, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid was more aimed at 
            boys, but they can be enjoyable for both genders. They are faster reads with large handwriting like fonts, 
            and are actually really fun. They are set in middle school, but they are very clean in their humor and 
            story telling. I am more familiar with Dork Diaries, so this review is more based off of that. DOrk Diaries
            does have an overarcing plot with call backs to other books. It gives kids a positive look at the "dorks" of
            middle school that shows that you don't have to be popular to have fun in middle school. <br> <br>
            <strong>Rating: 8/10 and 7/10 <br>Age rating:</strong> Third-sixth grade
