            <p class="homep"> 
                This page describes a list of great books from a highscooler's pov. 
                They may include some weird ones, but they are either considered classics or 
                are just generally interesting. This page includes movies based off of books that 
                are must sees, or should be avoided at all costs. These books are meant to be for 
                highschoolers or middle schoolers with a few for younger kids for the nostalga factor. 
                Books have ratings for maturity because some kids might see this and then read some gore.
                Remember that this is my own opinion and is neither right or wrong. Except that Order of the 
                Pheonix is a bad book. That's just the truth. But everyone can have their own opinions, grow up. <br>
                Sincerely, the Creator.</p>
